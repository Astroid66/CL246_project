# CL246_project
A course project of optimising Heat transfer in headgear. We model a head gear which would provide better ventilation and designed it with a proper material to reduce the radiative heat transfer. Therefore, our model will increase the temperature of the hed with a smaller rate as compared to the headgear available in the morket.
